  After a lot of outright theft, I leave this repo, but I will continue my work in private, but Luna obviously continues to evolve, so add her :b

**Cesium** is an open source discord bot fully customizable created in javascript, using [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) and [VultrexDB](https://github.com/VultrexDev/vultrexdb) ! Feel free to fork this bot. I am planning on abandoning this project and continue on working on it in private most likely.

## Features
- Moderation
- Games such as 8ball
- Experience and ranking system
- There are some more commands as well

## Credits
- GrowlyX for the first main commands (zBot was revamped after a while by me since the project was dead)
- Sentinel (Old Project I worked on with a friend)
